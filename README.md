# Todolist
This is a simple, responsive To-Do List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, mark, and delete tasks in an interactive and visually appealing way. The app features a vibrant animated background, making it both functional and modern in design.

🎨 Features
✅ Add Tasks: Users can enter a task in the input field and click the “Add” button to create a new task item.

🗑️ Delete Tasks: Each task comes with a clickable ❌ (cross) icon to remove the task.

✔️ Mark Completed: Clicking on a task toggles its completion state (with a check icon and line-through text).

💾 Save Tasks in LocalStorage: Tasks are saved locally in the browser, so they persist even after a page refresh.

🌈 Animated Gradient Background: The background includes a smooth, continuous color animation using CSS keyframes, creating a visually dynamic experience.

📱 Responsive Design: The app works well across desktop and mobile devices.
